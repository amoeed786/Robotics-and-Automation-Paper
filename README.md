# Robotics and Automation: A Necessary Evil 🚀

## 📌 Introduction
Welcome to the repository for **"Robotics and Automation: A Necessary Evil"**, an advanced statistics research project conducted at the **University of the Punjab**. This study delves into the ever-evolving fields of **Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics, and Automation**, exploring their current progress, societal impact, and potential future transformations.

## 📖 Abstract
In an era dominated by AI and automation, many misconceptions surround these technologies. Our project aims to **bridge the knowledge gap**, highlighting the **benefits, challenges, and ethical considerations** associated with automation. Through **survey-based analysis and statistical evaluation**, we provide insights into **public perception, developer opinions, and real-world applications** of robotics and automation.

## 🔬 Research Methodology
To analyze the impact and perception of robotics and automation, we used:
- **📊 Correlation Analysis** – Identifying relationships between variables such as training data and robotic performance.
- **📈 Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test** – Evaluating differences in opinions between consumer groups, developers, and industry experts.

## 📝 Key Findings
Our research collected data from diverse groups, revealing that:
- **74.2% of travelers** report a positive impact of automation in travel experiences.
- **39% of respondents** believe that increased training data **significantly** enhances robotic system performance.
- **63.6% of developers** see AI as a key efficiency enhancer in automation.
- **45% of respondents** feel that removing automation from their lives would have a **significant impact**.
- **47.5% believe** automation **improves productivity**, but **35% fear job displacement**.


## 📢 Key Takeaways
- Automation is **not inherently good or bad**; the challenge lies in achieving a **balance**.
- Public perception varies by exposure, with **developers viewing AI as a tool for efficiency**, while **consumers worry about job displacement**.
- The **future of automation requires a flexible industry and education system** to ensure **responsible AI integration**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** (for statistical analysis)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (data processing)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (visualizations)
- **Scikit-learn** (data modeling)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (analysis & documentation)
